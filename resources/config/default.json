//  1) The config/CreativeBlocks directory has no .json files in it (to create default.json on the first install)
//  2) config/CreativeBlocks/default.json exists (to update default.json when the mod updates)
//
// If you want to customize this file, you must rename it.
// Otherwise, simply create new .json files with the same structure and leave this file alone.
